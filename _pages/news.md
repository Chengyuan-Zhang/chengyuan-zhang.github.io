* 11/2022:  The preprint of our recent work "Discovering dynamic patterns from spatiotemporal data with time-varying
  low-rank autoregression" is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15482). The adapted datasets and Python
  implementation are available at [https://github.com/xinychen/vars](https://github.com/xinychen/vars).
* 11/2022: Our long paper
  on [Social Interactions for Autonomous Driving](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/ROB-078) is accepted by
  Foundations and Trends in Robotics.
* 11/2022: Our 1st International Workshop
  on [Socially Interactive Autonomous Mobility (SIAM)](https://interactive-driving.github.io/) will be hosted at the
  2023 #IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV23') in Anchorage, Alaska, USA (June 4 – 7, 2023). Welcome to submit your
  paper!
