I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil Engineering, McGill University. I received my B.S. degree in Vehicle
Engineering from Chongqing University in 2019. From 2019 to 2020, I was as a visiting researcher with the Department
of Mechanical Engineering, UC Berkeley. My research interests are Bayesian learning, macro/micro driving behavior
analysis, and multi-agent interaction modeling in intelligent transportation systems.
